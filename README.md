## Maverick-Healthcare Chatbot

The Project's main motivation is to reduce the pressure on primary care providers and assist people in learning to take responsibility for their health. The goal of this healthcare bot is to give patients with individualized health and useful information. Patients with products and services, as well as diagnostics and treatment recommendations. According to the patient's symptoms This healthcare bot technology will assist hospitals in providing better patient care. Healthcare help is available online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and it addresses both specific and general queries. By asking the questions in order, patients are guided as to what they are getting into. This, in turn, aids the doctor in gathering information about the patient prior to any physical engagement. 

**Why is this bot now required?**

Bots are automated services that individuals communicate with via a messaging app. Instead of conversing with another human, the user converses with a bot driven by either simple rules or machine learning. Every bot has a purpose, and health bots are developed to assist with medical difficulties. More exact diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on patients' symptoms. Design to assist with health-related concerns Improved user interface. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind building Maverick is to demonstrate the features and the extent to which bots can reach if they are implemented properly. If they are implemented properly, they can be used to replace more traditional options. A bot should be easy to use by all the generations and have a fairly quick response time and it should be user friendly. Their goal should be making the user experience faster & reliable, making sure that they don't waste users time with useless information. 
The conversation flow between the end user and a bot should be effortless and the end user shouldn't feel like he's/she’s talking to a machine.
There are countless cases where intelligent medical bots could help physicians, nurses, therapists, patients, or their families.
They can step in and minimize the amount of time they spend on tasks like:
- ➢ providing health-related information to users
- ➢ guidance for patient
- ➢ medication management and dosage
- ➢ FAQ-type queries (contact details, directions, opening hours and service/treatment details)

It’s important to note that despite the fact that chatbots can offer valuable facts and symptoms, they aren’t qualified to give an official diagnosis.
The main premise behind these talking or texting smart algorithms is to become the first point of contact before any human involvement is needed.

### Problem Definition
No one wants to talk about mental health because it's the elephant in the room. Although India is on the edge of a mental health crisis, there is little public discussion on how to avoid or cure it. There are few efforts being done at the scale necessary to deal with the growing number of persons suffering from mental illnesses. Corona is to blame for the significant increase in instances. 

Isolation as a result of lockdown, dread and uncertainty as a result of employment layoffs, and overall discomfort as a result of not being able to manage various elements of life have all contributed to significant emotional trauma in people across the country. The situation is further compounded by the fact that no one knows when, if ever, things will return to normal.

There is a significant gap between the therapy that should be offered and the aid that is conveniently and affordably available. The ratio of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric social workers, and mental health nurses to patients is 1: 10,000 even in industrialized nations. The system's flaw assures that most
people with mental health problems will never receive the treatment they require.
